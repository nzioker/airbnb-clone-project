# Airbnb Clone Backend â€“ Features and Functionalities

This document presents the core, technical, and non-functional requirements for the Airbnb Clone backend.

## 1. Core Functionalities
The backend must provide:
- User Management (Registration, Authentication, Profiles)
- Property Listings CRUD operations
- Search and Filtering by location, price, and amenities
- Booking system with date validation and status tracking
- Payment processing via Stripe/PayPal with multi-currency support
- Reviews and Ratings tied to bookings
- Notifications for bookings, payments, and cancellations
- Admin dashboard for system management

## 2. Technical Requirements
- Relational database (PostgreSQL/MySQL) with normalized schema
- RESTful APIs following standard HTTP methods
- JWT authentication with role-based access control (RBAC)
- File storage (local for now, scalable to S3/Cloudinary)
- Email notifications via SendGrid/Mailgun
- Centralized error handling and logging

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
- Scalability through modular architecture and load balancing
- Security with encryption and rate limiting
- Performance optimization with caching (Redis)
- Testing: unit, integration, and automated API testing
